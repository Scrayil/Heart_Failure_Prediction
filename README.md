# Heart_Failure_Prediction
The project involves data preprocessing, visualization of outliers, model training, and evaluation using cross-validation.  
The performance of individual models, such as Random Forest, GLMNet, and XGBoost, is assessed, and their variable importance is analyzed.  
The combined model's accuracy is evaluated and compared to the base models.
